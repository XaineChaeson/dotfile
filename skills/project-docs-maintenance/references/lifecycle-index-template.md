# Lifecycle Index Template

Use this when a lifecycle example is too large for a single page. The index must
still expose full coverage and a runnable happy-path subset without deep navigation.

## Goal
- <User goal in one sentence>

## Scope / Non-goals
- Scope: <what this walkthrough covers>
- Non-goals: <what it does not cover>

## Coverage matrix
> Must cover all public entrypoints from `docs/dev/interfaces/*`.
| Area | Lifecycle page | Entrypoints | Notes |
|------|----------------|------------|-------|
| <module/product> | <link> | <list> | <notes> |

## Lifecycle sequence (summary)
1) <init>
2) <discover/setup>
3) <run>
4) <recovery>
5) <teardown>

## Runnable happy-path subset
> Must be runnable or explicitly labeled as pseudo. This is the happy-path subset.

```pseudo
<short end-to-end example>
```

## Variants (links)
- <link to phase or product pages>

## Risks and recovery (short)
- <top failure mode and recovery entrypoint>
