# Writing Style

- Use short, direct sentences.
- Prefer lists and tables over long paragraphs.
- Define terms once and reuse the exact names.
- Keep examples minimal and runnable when possible.
- Use Mermaid for diagrams in Markdown.
- Add a short Related docs section at the end of each doc.
- Define new terms on first use and link to a glossary when available.
- Keep example blocks labeled with inputs and expected outputs.
- Use user voice in `docs/user/` and developer voice in `docs/dev/`.
- Standardize units and time formats (e.g., ms, UTC, ISO-8601).
- Link any stability/version mentions to the interface index or changelog.
- Prefer single-page lifecycle walkthroughs; use tables and anchors before splitting.
