# Consistency Checklist

- Entrypoints in docs exist in code and names match.
- Defaults and required fields match code behavior.
- Config keys and schema match current implementation.
- Errors and edge cases reflect current code paths.
- Examples are runnable or explicitly marked as pseudocode.
- Architecture diagrams align with current modules.
- Module docs reflect actual boundaries and responsibilities.
- Change log or devlog updated when public behavior changes.
